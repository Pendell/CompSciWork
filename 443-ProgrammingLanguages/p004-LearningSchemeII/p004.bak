; This is the recursive helper function to the caesar function below.
; It takes a number generated from the parent function which is the offset to move all the following characters as well as a list representation of the string
; It returns a new string that is essentially the old string shifted via the 'shift' parameter.
; THIS STILL PRINTS UNICODE FOR SOME REASON...

; we then take that number and add it to the normal english alphabet, which will decipher the word for us.

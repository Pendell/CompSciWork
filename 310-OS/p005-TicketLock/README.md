Compiling:
Navigate inside the project folder (if you see MakeFile, you're in the right place!).
Open the terminal in this folder, and type Make to tell the MakeFile to invoke the
G++ compiler and create the necessary executables for this program.

Once Make has finished, enter '/build/ticketLockTest' in the command prompt to run the
program.

Testing:
After executing the program multiple times, the value output is what it's to be expected.
That is, the given 3 threads run 10 times each, and give the expected output of 30.

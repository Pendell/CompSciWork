To compile, navigate inside the pVSSD folder (you should see a file called Makefile).

From there, open the terminal inside this directory, and enter 'make'. This will
invoke the makefile and compile and link the necessary files to create our executable.

Once that has completed, enter the command 'build/vssd-test' to execute the program.

When the program executes, enter the '?' character for further instructions for operating
the VSSD.

Precompiling Busywork:
Before (or after, it doesn't matter that much) compiling, make sure that the input file you want to draw from is located in "p001/src/" and has the name "input1.txt". The program makes a few assumptions about the file you're giving it, and one of them is that file is named "input1.txt".

Compiling:
To compile, simply navigate to /p001/src/, and enter "javac *.java" into bash. This will compile all of the java programs for executions.

Execution:
To execute, once again navigate to /p001/src/, and enter "java Main" to execute the main executable.

Afterwards, sit back and watch the vacuum bonk into all kinds of walls and furniture!

/* Alex Pendell
 * CIS 421 - Artificial Intelligence
 * Assignment 4 - Ant Colony Optimization
 * November 4th, 2019 <-- Don't let this one slip, Alex!
 *                        No more late assignments!
 *
 * Ant Colony Optimization: The start point is always Blue
 * Mountains, and the end point is always Iron Hills. Since
 * this is not a travelling sales person problem, we don't
 * care about visiting every node in Middle Earth.
 * 
 * Overview: Our ants will begin from "Blue Mountains" and will
 * always end at "Iron Hills". Since this is not TSP, we don't
 * care about visiting every node in the graph. We will run the
 * experiment 5 times.
 * 1st experiment will favor the hueristic.
 * 2nd experiment will favor the pheromone level.
 * 3rd experiment eliminates hueristic entirely.
 * 4th & 5th experiments will test the influence of different
 *     values for RHO.
 *
 * Some considerations given to use via the write-up:
 * 1. As previously stated this is not a TSP problem. Caution
 *    is advised when referring to the code in the book.
 * 2. The graph used is not fully connected. We will need a way
 *    to backtrack if the ant agent gets stuck (trapped).
 * 3. Pheromone evaporation can be be done either before OR
 *    after depositing new pheromone. It is advised to experiment
 *    with both and see if results reflect any difference.
 *

/* What do we need to do...
 * 1. Distribute pheromone randomly about the edges (This should be done in
 *      MiddleEarth.java -> Just add a random number generator to each edge as
 *      it's created.
 * 2. Initialize an Ant -> ??? Unsure about what I'm going to need to attach to
 *      it. Perhaps keep track of the path it's taken so far (Would make back-
 *      tracking a lot easier).
 * 3. After the Ant has completed it's trail, distribute pheromone to each of
 *      the edges it chose. 
 * 4. Evaporate the phermone via the evaporation equation. This can be done 
 *      before or after the previous step (3).
 * 5. Jump back to step 2 and repeat until the number of trials has elapsed.
